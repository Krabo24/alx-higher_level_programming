We will do these tasks for 0x0A-python-inheritance

Mandatory
1- Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:
2- Write a class MyList that inherits from list:
3- Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.
4- Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.
5- Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.
6- Write an empty class BaseGeometry.
7- Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
8- Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
9- Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).
10- Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)
11- Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py):

Instantiation with size: def __init__(self, size)::
size must be private. No getter or setter
size must be a positive integer, validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
12- Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).

Instantiation with size: def __init__(self, size)::
size must be private. No getter or setter
size must be a positive integer, validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
print() should print, and str() should return, the square description: [Square] <width>/<height>
13- Write a class MyInt that inherits from int:

Advanced tasks
MyInt is a rebel. MyInt has == and != operators inverted
You are not allowed to import any module
14- Write a function that adds a new attribute to an object if it’s possible:

Raise a TypeError exception, with the message can't add new attribute if the object can’t have new attribute
